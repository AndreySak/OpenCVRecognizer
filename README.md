# OpenCVRecognizer
Using OpenCV from Swift simple demo

This is simple demo how to use OpenCV object detection functionality from Swift.

Project implements recognizing for car licence plates. I use Haar cascade model from standard OpenCV delivery.

Project uses OpenCV iOS framework but I didn't add it on github because it's too big. 
So, if you want to run project you have to download it and add opencv.framework manually.
